# Pagination

In this guide, we will look at how to work with paginated responses when querying the Protocol API. By default, all responses limit results to ten. However, you can go as high as 100 by adding a `limit` parameter to your requests. If you are using one of the official Protocol API client libraries, you don't need to worry about pagination, as it's all being taken care of behind the scenes. {{ className: 'lead' }}

When an API response returns a list of objects, no matter the amount, pagination is supported. In paginated responses, objects are nested in a `data` attribute and have a `has_more` attribute that indicates whether you have reached the end of the last page. You can use the `starting_after` and `endding_before` query parameters to browse pages.

## Examples

<Row>
  <Col>

this is endpoint allows you retrieve a paginated list of all you roles, by default, a maximum of then roles of ten roles are shown per page.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="Page" type="integer">
      the page number of roles returned.
      </Property>
      <Property name="pageSize" type="integer">
       the page size of roles returned.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  
  <Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="POST" label="/v1/role">

     ```js {{ title: 'Request' }}
        const response = axios.get('/v1/role' {
          page:1,
          pageSize:10
        })
      ```

    </CodeGroup>


    ```json {{ title: 'response' }}
    {
      "roles":[
        ....
      ],
      "data": {
        "page":1,
        "pageSizae":10,
        "pageCount":1,
        "totalDocument":25
      }
    }
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>
